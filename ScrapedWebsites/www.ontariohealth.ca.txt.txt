Highlights include updates to the COVID-19 severity classification and risk factors associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes, along with an overview of the real-world evidence for antiviral therapies.Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 such as Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and Veklury (remdesivir) can prevent serious illness in certain high-risk individuals if taken within the first few days after symptoms start. Individuals should have mild or moderate symptoms and a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 before receiving antiviral therapy.Antiviral therapy is recommended for individuals who are:A health care provider may also consider prescribing antiviral therapy to adults who are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes because they have risk factors such as certain medical conditions or are unvaccinated.A patient’s risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 exists on a continuum and is influenced by many factors such as age, vaccination status, and immunocompromised status, together with the number, type, and degree of control of medical conditions. The list of risk factors included in the guidance document is intended to assist prescribers in making individualized treatment decisions based on their assessment of patient risk.Additional guidance on the treatment of severe to critical COVID-19 will be added in the future.Tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) is not recommended for pre-exposure prophylaxis or treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 due to reduced efficacy against recently strains of circulating SARS-CoV-2.The information on this website is intended for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for medical advice.
