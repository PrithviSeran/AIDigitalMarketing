For details, seebelow.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is advising people to perform repeat testing, also called serial testing, following a negative result on any at-home COVID-19 antigen test, to reduce the risk an infection may be missed (false negative result) and to help prevent people from unknowingly spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus to others.At-home COVID-19 antigen tests detect proteins, called antigens, from the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. At-home COVID-19 antigen tests are less likely to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus than molecular tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. This is especially true early in an infection or in people who do not have COVID-19 symptoms. Currently, all at-home COVID-19 antigen tests are FDA-authorized for repeat use. This means people should use multiple tests over a certain time period, such as 2-3 days, especially when the people using the tests don't have COVID-19 symptoms. Today, the FDA is highlighting the continued need for repeat testing when people get a negative result with an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, including recommending additional testing over a longer period of time.Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health scientists have continued to learn about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the impact of variants on diagnostic tests that detect SARS-CoV-2. Today's recommendations are based on the latest study results from people with likely omicron infection showing that repeat testing after a negative at-home COVID-19 antigen test result increases the chance of an accurate result. COVID-19 diagnostic testing remains a cornerstone of our nation's fight against COVID-19. At-home COVID-19 antigen tests, while not perfect, provide a fast and convenient COVID-19 testing option.Follow the test's step by step instructions exactly to perform the test and to read the test's results.COVID-19detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests that arefor self-testing at home, or anywhere. The FDA has authorized both molecular and antigen COVID-19 diagnostic tests for home use.Most at-home COVID-19 tests are antigen tests and do not detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as molecular tests, most of which are laboratory-based such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Molecular COVID-19 tests are generally expected to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus at least 95% of the time when someone is infected. However, at-home COVID-19 antigen tests are generally expected to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus at least 80% of the time when someone is infected.When you perform an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, and you get a positive result, the results are usually accurate. However, if you perform an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, you could get a false negative result. This means that the test may not detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is in your nasal swab sample. This could happen if you test soon after you get an infection, especially if you don't have. If you receive a false negative test result, you may unknowingly spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus to others.When at-home COVID-19 antigen tests were initially FDA-authorized, the FDA knew that for people to get accurate results, test instructions would need to include directions for repeat testing. The FDA believed the best way to better understand COVID-19 infections and evaluate test accuracy was to require test developers to perform follow up studies with their tests. The studies would need to assess how well COVID-19 antigen tests could detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially in people without COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, the FDA required each at-home COVID-19 antigen test manufacturer to assess how well their test works when used by people with and without COVID-19 symptoms following repeat testing instructions.In parallel, the FDA collaborated with the National Institutes for Health (NIH) and the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School and together they designed ato assess at-home COVID-19 antigen test performance. The study was funded by the NIH's Rapid Acceleration Diagnostics (RADx) Program and included more than 7,000 participants. The results of the study would be available as a resource to all at-home COVID-19 antigen test manufacturers.The study participants collected their nasal sample and performed an at-home COVID-19 antigen test. Participants who got a negative test result performed repeat testing every 48 hours, over 14 days. All participants also collected their nasal sample using a home collection kit and then sent the sample to a clinical laboratory for testing with an FDA-authorized molecular test. The study compared the performance of at-home COVID-19 antigen tests to performance of a laboratory-based molecular test.show that repeat testing over a longer timeframe improves test performance and increases the likelihood that an at-home COVID-19 antigen test will detect an infection. These results have further guided the FDA's thinking that repeat testing after a negative result with an at-home COVID-19 antigen test reduces the risk of a false negative result.On November 1, 2022, based on the data discussed in this safety communication, the FDA revised the authorized uses and required updates to the labeling for all currently authorized COVID-19 antigen tests regarding repeat testing after a negative COVID-19 test result.For additional information about the EUA revision, visit:For additional information about at-home tests, visit:The FDA is committed to assuring appropriately accurate and reliable at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests for all Americans and will keep the public informed if significant new information about COVID-19 antigen test performance becomes available.If you think you had a problem with your COVID-19 test, the FDA encourages you to.Health care personnel employed by facilities that are subject to the FDA's user facility reporting requirements should follow the reporting procedures established by their facilities.If you have questions, email the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) ator call 800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100.Skip to main contentSkip to FDA SearchSkip to in this section menuSkip to footer linksHere’s how you knowReport a Product ProblemContact FDAFDA Guidance DocumentsRecalls, Market Withdrawals and Safety AlertsPress AnnouncementsWarning LettersAdvisory CommitteesEn EspañolFoodDrugsMedical DevicesRadiation-Emitting ProductsVaccines, Blood, and BiologicsAnimal and VeterinaryCosmeticsTobacco ProductsAbout FDACombination ProductsRegulatory InformationSafetyEmergency PreparednessInternational ProgramsNews and EventsTraining and Continuing EducationInspections and ComplianceScience and ResearchConsumersPatientsIndustryHealth ProfessionalsFederal, State and Local OfficialsIn this sectionSafety Communications2024 Safety Communications2023 Safety Communications2022 Safety CommunicationsHomeMedical DevicesMedical Device SafetySafety CommunicationsAt-Home COVID-19 Antigen Tests-Take Steps to Reduce Your Risk of False Negative Results: FDA Safety CommunicationSafety CommunicationsSharePostLinkedinEmailPrintEspañolFDA ActionsAt-Home OTC COVID-19 Diagnostic TestsCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidancediagnostic testsFDA-authorizedCOVID-19 symptomscomprehensive studyResults from this studyAntigen EUA Revisions for Serial (Repeat) TestingAt-Home OTC COVID-19 Diagnostic Testsreport the problem through the MedWatch Voluntary Reporting FormDICE@FDA.HHS.GOVSafety Communications2024 Safety Communications2023 Safety Communications2022 Safety CommunicationsFDA ArchiveAbout FDAAccessibilityVisitor InformationWebsite Policies / PrivacyNo FEAR ActVulnerability Disclosure PolicyFOIAHHS.govUSA.govContact FDATopAn official website of the United States governmentSearchMenuSubmit search:                Safety CommunicationsFollow FDA on FacebookFollow FDA on XFollow FDA on InstagramFollow FDA on LinkedInView FDA videos on YouTubeSubscribe to FDA RSS feedsFDA HomepageContact NumberBack toU.S. Food and Drug AdministrationAt-Home COVID-19 Antigen Tests-Take Steps to Reduce Your Risk of False Negative Results: FDA Safety CommunicationFeaturedProductsTopicsInformation ForRecommendations:BackgroundFDA ActionsReporting Problems with Your DeviceQuestions?Content current as of:Regulated Product(s)Health Topic(s)Footer LinksBefore you use a COVID-19 antigen test:When you use an at-home COVID-19 antigen test:After you use an at-home COVID-19 antigen test:Overall performance of at-home COVID-19 antigen testsStudies to better understand at-home COVID-19 antigen test performanceBe aware that at-home COVID-19 antigen tests are less accurate than molecular tests.

The FDA remains committed to providing notice and information to all impacted stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition.Importantly, the ending of the PHE declared by HHS under the PHS Act will not impact FDA’s ability to authorize devices (including tests), treatments or vaccines for emergency use. Existing emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for products will remain in effect and the agency may continue to issue new EUAs going forward when criteria for issuance are met.For additional resources from HHS, see:.On this page:|||1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)Federal government websites often end in .gov or .mil.

An EUA declaration is based on specific, also under section 564 of the FD&C Act, of emergencies/threats or potential emergencies/threats by the Secretaries of HHS, Homeland Security, or Defense.On March 17, 2023, HHSthat, effective March 15, 2023, the HHS Secretarymade pursuant to section 564 of the FD&C Act and determined pursuant to his authority under section 564(b)(1)(C) that there is a public health emergency, or a significant potential for a public health emergency, that affects, or has a significant potential to affect, national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad and that involves a biological agent, namely the novel (new) coronavirus (nCoV) first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in 2019 (SARS-CoV-2).The four previously-issued section 564 declarations that refer to the February 4, 2020 determination have not been terminated by the Secretary because, among other things, the circumstances described in section 564(b)(1) continue to exist—i.e., COVID-19, a disease attributable to SARS-CoV-2, continues to present a public health emergency, or a significant potential for a public health emergency, that affects, or has a significant potential to affect, national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad. Consistent with section 564(f), the currently-in-effect EUAs issued under those section 564 declarations remain in effect until the earlier of the termination of relevant section 564 declarations under section 564(b), or revocation of the EUAs. Therefore, these EUAs, including for tests, other devices, treatments, and vaccines, continue to remain in effect.If the HHS Secretary terminates an EUA declaration, then any EUAs issued based on that declaration will cease to be in effect, and FDA may no longer issue EUAs for products covered by that declaration.As noted above, an EUA declaration is distinct from, and not dependent on, a PHE declaration under section 319 of the PHS Act, and, therefore, an EUA may remain in effect beyond the duration of the section 319 PHE declaration if all other statutory conditions are met.If an EUA declaration is terminated, notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register. Before an EUA declaration is terminated, the HHS Secretary will issue a Federal Register notice providing advance notice to the public that the EUA declaration is being terminated. This starts the transition, which must be of a reasonable period to allow for proper dispositioning.FDA recognizes that it will take time for manufacturers, health care facilities, providers, patients, and other stakeholders to transition from EUA devices and the policies that support them. FDA developed theto describe a transition plan, among other things, to help avoid disruption in device supply and help facilitate compliance with applicable FD&C Act requirements after the termination of the relevant device EUA declaration related to COVID-19.For medical devices issued EUAs related to COVID-19, see FDA's guidance,.In general, an EUA will remain in effect for the duration of the EUA declaration under which it was issued. There are two mechanisms, termination or revocation, that result in an EUA no longer being in effect:Examples of circumstances that may make revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety are described in the FDA guidance:.FDA lists terminated and revoked EUAs on our website at:In the Federal Register of March 13, 2023, FDAaddressing the Agency’s, including which of those guidance documents will no longer be in effect after the expiration of the PHE, and which of those guidance documents FDA is revising to temporarily continue in effect.

If so, can FDA continue to issue EUAs after the public health emergency is over?Q2: Once the public health emergency under the PHS Act is over, what becomes of medical products (such as drugs, tests, vaccines) that have an EUA?Q3: How are EUAs terminated or revoked?Q4: What is the impact of PHE termination on FDA guidance documents?The declaration generally lasts for 90 days, but may beby the HHS Secretary.  After each extension, the declaration lasts for 90 days or until the HHS Secretary declares the emergency no longer exists, whichever occurs first.A section 319 PHE declaration does not enable FDA to issue EUAs.A section 319 PHE declaration allows HHS to take appropriate actions in response to the emergency consistent with other authorities, including: making grants; entering into contracts; and conducting and supporting investigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of the disease or disorder.The HHS Secretary issued a section 319 PHE declaration for COVID-19 in, andit every 3 months until May 11, 2023.Unlike the section 319 PHE declaration that expires if not extended, an EUA declaration under section 564 of the FD&C Act generally continues until the HHS Secretary terminates it.An EUA declaration is distinct from, and not dependent on, an HHS PHE declaration under section 319 of the PHS Act, and, therefore, an EUA may remain in effect beyond the duration of the section 319 PHE declaration if all other statutory conditions are met.EUAs may remain authorized and new EUAs may continue being issued so long as the applicable EUA declaration and determination remains in effect.Whether FDA can continue to issue EUAs depends in part on whether any applicable EUA declarations, which are based on emergency/threat determinations under section 564 of the FD&C Act remain in effect.The HHS Secretary issued a determination under section 564 of the FD&C Act (initiallyFebruary 4, 2020, andMarch 15, 2023) that there is a public health emergency, or significant potential for a public health emergency, that affects or has a significant potential to affect, national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and that involves a novel (new) coronavirus (nCoV) in 2019 (COVID-19). Based on the HHS determination, HHS issued 4 EUA declarations, for:;;; and.Section 564(f)(2) of the FD&C Act notes certain instances where there can be continued use of the EUA product notwithstanding the termination of the EUA declaration or revocation of the EUA (seein Question 2 below).For EUAs covering unapproved products, the transition will allow a sufficient period for proper dispositioning of the product.For EUAs covering, the transition will allow a sufficient period for proper dispositioning of any labeling or other materials associated with the authorization.Note: Under section 564(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, authorization of ancontinues to be effective, even after termination of the EUA declaration or revocation of the EUA, to provide for continued use with respect to a patient to whom it was administered while the declaration remained effective (to the extent found necessary by the patient’s physician).If an EUA declaration (under section 564 of the FD&C Act) is terminated, then all EUAs issued pursuant to that EUA declaration cease to be in effect on the date of the termination of HHS’s EUA declaration under section 564 of the FD&C Act (except in certain instances where there can be continued use of the EUA product in accordance with section 564(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, as noted above).An individual EUA may be revoked by FDA (prior to termination of the EUA declaration supporting it) if:The circumstances justifying issuance no longer exist,The criteria for its issuance are no longer met, orOther circumstances make revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.Guidance:From HHS:From HHS:, including resources and fact sheets about the transitionFrom HHS:(May 9, 2023)From HHS:, including "How does the end of the PHE affect PREP Act coverage for COVID-19 countermeasures?"Guidance:(April 2023) -(1 hour, 28 minutes ),(PDF, 361 KB),(PDF, 979 KB)BiologicsDrugsMedical DevicesEmergenciesCoronavirusThe .gov means it’s official.The site is secure.https://May 12, 2023 update:A:of the Public Health Service (PHS) Actof the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) ActA:Transition period prior to termination and disposition of medical products:A:A:Consumers and general information:Press:Product sponsors:Other stakeholders:In vitrounapproved product1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)Federal government websites often end in .gov or .mil.
