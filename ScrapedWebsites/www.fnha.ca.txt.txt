Getting a flu vaccine helps reduce the risk of flu for yourself, your family and your community.Cases of the flu were relatively low in BC last year due to strong flu vaccination rates and public health measures that were taken to stop the spread of COVID-19.​This shows that we can prevent flu-related illnesses (and flu-related hospitalizations and deaths) if we all take preventative measures. These preventative measures include getting a flu shot, regular handwashing, staying home when sick, wearing masks and physical distancing.Everyone who is six months and older should get a flu shot! However, the flu shot is particularly important for those who are most at risk for flu-related illness, including Elders, infants and young children, pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions. It's also recommended for healthy people who live with, care for, or visit those most at risk.Due to many social and environmental factors, including a high risk of chronic health conditions occurring and reduced access to health care, First Nations people are at a higher risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death when they experience the flu or COVID-19.​Influenza (the flu) is a contagious respiratory disease that can lead to serious illness, hospitalization and even death. Everyone is at risk of getting the flu and spreading it to others. Getting immunized helps protect you and those around you by reducing the spread.Yes, you can get the flu vaccine at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccine or any time before or after.The flu shot is safe for all ages and health conditions. The vaccines have undergone a rigorous review to ensure they are safe and effective before they are approved by Health Canada.The flu shot is free to all BC residents, including First Nations and Indigenous people both on and off-reserve.Yes, as well as getting a flu shot, you can follow public health recommendations. These regular handwashing, staying home when sick, wearing masks and physical distancing.Flu shots are available at your health centre or nursing station, or in your doctor's office or your local pharmacy. Contact your local Community Health Nurse to make an appointment at your health center or visitto find a flu vaccine clinic near you.Turn on more accessible modeTurn off more accessible modeSkip
