This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us.This policy describesare covered under this policy,vulnerability reports, andwe ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they’ve discovered – as set out in this policy – so we can fix them and keep our users safe. We have developed this policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and HHS will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research.Under this policy, “research” means activities in which you:Once you’ve established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information, or proprietary information or trade secrets of any party),.All systems and services associated with domains listed below are in scope.  Likewise, subdomains of each listing, unless explicitly excluded, are always in scope.  Additionally, any website published with a link to this policy shall be considered in scope.  Vulnerabilities found in non-federal systems from our vendors fall outside of this policy’s scope and should be reported directly to the vendor according to their disclosure policy (if any). If you aren’t sure whether a system or endpoint is in scope or not, contactbefore starting your research or at the security contact for the system’s domain name listed in the.Though we develop and maintain other internet-accessible systems or services, we ask that active research and testing only be conducted on the systems and services covered by the scope of this document. If there is a system not in scope that you think merits testing, please contact us to discuss it first. We will increase the scope of this policy over time.acf.govchildcare.govchildwelfare.govfatherhood.govacf.hhs.govacl.govagingstats.govaoa.goveldercare.govlongtermcare.govwhaging.govwhitehouseconferenceonaging.govnamrs.netmepstech.comahcpr.govahrq.govguideline.govguidelines.govcerts.hhs.govcahpsusernetwork.netahrqadmin.orgahrqdev.orgchainonline.orgmepsdocs.orgpccds-ln.orgpcorcds-ln.orgpsoppc.orgsitenv.orguspreventiveservicestaskforce.orgcdc.govcdcpartners.govcoronavirus.govflu.govhealthindicators.govmillionhearts.hhs.govncvhs.hhs.govvaers.hhs.govpandemicflu.govselectagents.govsimplereport.gove-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.govvaccine.govvaccines.govvacine.govvacines.govvacuna.govvacunas.govthecommunityguide.orgcsscoperations.comcms.govcuidadodesalud.govhealthcare.govcms.hhs.govinsurekidsnow.govmedicaid.govmedicalbillrights.govmedicare.govmymedicare.govqualitynet.orghcgov.usbetobaccofree.govfda.govblogs.fda.govceportal.fda.govgovdashboard.fda.govlabels.fda.govbetobaccofree.hhs.govnextlegends.govtherealcost.govtobacco.govcares.linkhealth.comcovid19.linkhealth.comdonaciondeorganos.govtelehealth.hhs.govhrsa.govorgandonor.govhv-impact.edc.orgihs.govdirectihs.netalzheimers.govbrain.govbrainhealth.govcancer.govcerebrosano.govclinicaltrial.govclinicaltrials.govcollegedrinkingprevention.govdiabetescommittee.govdocline.govdrugabuse.govedison.goveverytrycounts.govgenome.govhearttruth.govagreementbuilder.hhs.govasrp.hhs.govcollaborate-acl.hhs.govdas.hhs.govocrportal.hhs.govoga.hhs.govomhaportal.hhs.govsafetyreporting.hhs.goviedison.govlocatorplus.govmedlineplus.govmesh.govncifcrf.govnih.govnlm.govnnlm.govpubmed.govsmokefree.govthebraininitiative.govthisfreelife.govtox21.govncats.iobrainattackcoalition.orgcharmm.orgcitdbase.orgcoronaviruspreventionnetwork.orgctsu.orggem-measures.orggenomereference.orgnci-fyi.orgncihub.orgnhlbiwgs.orgproteincapture.orgscienceforum.schhsoig.govoig.hhs.govworklife4you.comaids.govbioethics.govcovid.govcovidtest.govcovidtests.govdhhs.govfitness.govfoodsafety.govgirlshealth.govgrants.govgrantsolutions.govhealth.govhealthdata.govhealthfinder.govhealthit.govhealthypeople.govhhs.govhiv.govmedicalcountermeasures.govopioids.govphe.govpsc.govstopbullying.govsurgeongeneral.govusphs.govwomenshealth.govyouth.govoahpmdata.netfindtreatment.govmentalhealth.govrecoverymonth.govsamhsa.govstopalcoholabuse.govWe accept vulnerability reports at.
