detect the virus itself. Instead, they detect the antibodies produced in response to a previous infection by SARS-CoV-2  virus or in response to vaccination. Serological tests are not appropriate for  diagnosing COVID-19 and do not indicate if you have immunity.Health Canada has authorized the sale of serological tests used to detect antibodies. Consult the.For more information on how serological testing is being used in Canada, please consult the Public Health Agency of Canada’s page on.Health Canada has  published a resource on.The immune response to a virus involves the creation of different types of antibodies produced at different stages of an infection:The  relationship between antibodies in response to  infection and immunity to infection with SARS-CoV-2 is still  unknown. It’s unclear whether people with antibodies from previous  infection are immune to re-infection or if they are still  infectious to others.The sensitivity of serological testing in elderly or immuno-compromised people is unknown. This is because their age or condition can have an impact on their body's immune response.Also, antibodies are present for an undetermined period of time after an infection has ended.For the above reasons, serological test results should be interpreted with caution.Variants of a virus are versions of the virus in which the nucleic acids  are different. Variants can affect the performance of a test. A false negative  result can occur with any test. However, the test is more likely to give a  false negative result if what it detects is changed as a result of the  differences in the variant.The impact of variants on each test will depend on:A negative test result should be considered along with a person’s  symptoms, history of exposure to the virus and the variant of virus that is  common in their area.Given that virus variants are common and expected,  Health Canada continues to review available information. We work with other  regulators and manufacturers of COVID-19 test devices to monitor any impact  that variants may have on the ability of diagnostic tests approved by Health  Canada to detect COVID-19 variants. If an issue is identified, we will work  quickly with manufacturers and public health laboratories to mitigate those  risks.Health  Canada encourages manufacturers to consider using recycled/recyclable,  reusable, compostable and sustainable materials when developing test devices.  For instance, manufacturers could consider using recycled/recyclable packaging  materials and inserts and/or reducing one-time use testing components for  self-tests.The  Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network releasedin May 2020. It  recommended that serology tests could be used to inform public health  responses. However, at this time, near patient serological assays for  SARS-CoV-2 shouldn’t be used for clinical testing.Based on this information, we  will not accept amendment applications to add point-of-care claims to serology  tests that have already been authorized by Health Canada.Before submitting an application  under Part 1.1 of the(MDR), manufacturers  should consult the(UPHN list). An application can only be  submitted under Part 1.1 for a device in Part 1 of the UPHN list or a device  thatbelongs to a category of devices that is in Part 2 of the UPHN  list.For information on how to apply  for medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19 under Part 1.1 of the MDR,  please consult the following guidance document:For serological test requirements, please consult the following:In accordance with the guidance, we will be placing a 'condition' on all authorized serological tests. This action will allow us to monitor performance once the technology is in use in Canada.Health Canada has additional labelling specifications for vaccinations  and emerging variants that are not included in the FDA guidances.For more information on the current variants of public health concern, please consult thepage.Due to the approval and distribution of vaccines in Canada,  manufacturers must include a statement with the same meaning as the following:“The performance of this device  has not been assessed in a population vaccinated against COVID-19.”Manufacturers who submit evidence of their device’s performance in a  vaccinated population may have this  requirement waived.Manufacturers of serological assays that target the spike protein must  include 3 statements with the same meaning as the following:In light of a number of SARS-CoV-2 variants of public health concern that have emerged,  Health Canada requires the following before an application may be authorized:“The  performance of this test was established based on the evaluation of a limited  number of clinical specimens. Clinical performance has not been established  with all circulating variants but is anticipated to reflect the prevalent  variants in circulation at the time and the location of the clinical  evaluation. Performance at the time of testing may vary depending on the  variants circulating, including newly emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 and their  prevalence, which change over time.”Manufacturers who  submit evidence on how their device performs in specimens from people infected  with emerging variants may be able to have this requirement adjusted.Health Canada requires that manufacturers include thepamphlet for  point-of-care serological tests. This resource explains the limitations of test  results to patients.However, for the purposes of distribution, manufacturers may include either  a physical copy or the internet address for this pamphlet in their labelling  materials. Make sure that all potential users are able to access the  information.Manufacturers will have to indicate to Health Canada which approach they  will use. If they choose to include the internet address in their labelling  materials, they will have to submit the adjusted labelling materials for  review.While notfor lab-based serological  tests, manufacturers should include this information in their labelling.For information about the licensing or authorization of medical devices in Canada, please contact the Medical Devices Directorate at.Skip to main contentSkip to "About government"Jobs and the workplaceImmigration and citizenshipTravel and tourismBusiness and industryBenefitsHealthTaxesEnvironment and natural resourcesNational security and defenceCulture, history and sportPolicing, justice and emergenciesTransport and infrastructureCanada and the worldMoney and financesScience and innovationCanada.caHealthDiseases and conditionsCoronavirus disease (COVID-19)COVID-19 health product industryCOVID-19 medical devicesOverviewNucleic acid testing devicesAntigen testing devicesSerological testing devicesPoint-of-care and self-testing devicesTest swabs safety and effectiveness guidancemedical devicesSerological testsUnderstanding serological testing resultsVariantsSustainabilitySerological point-of-care testingHow to get an authorizationlist of authorized testing devicesserology testingInformation for patients on COVID-19  antibody (serology) testinga statement  on point-of-care serology testing for COVID-19Medical  devices for use in relation to COVID-19Guidance on the requirements  for serological antibody testsNotice on sensitivity and specificity values for COVID-19 serological  testing devicesSARS-CoV-2 emerging variantsinformation for patients on COVID-19 antibody  (serology) testingmeddevices-instrumentsmed@hc-sc.gc.caRequirements for serological antibody tests submitted under the COVID-19 interim order - guidance documentCOVID-19 serological testing devices: Notice on sensitivity and specificity valuesCOVID-19 medical devicesList of testing devices for COVID-19: Applications under evaluationAuthorized medical devices for uses related to COVID-19Contact usAll contactsDepartments and agenciesAbout governmentJobsImmigration and citizenshipTravel and tourismBusinessBenefitsHealthTaxesEnvironment and natural resourcesNational security and defenceCulture, history and sportPolicing, justice and emergenciesTransport and infrastructureCanada and the worldMoney and financeScience and innovationIndigenous peoplesVeterans and militaryYouthSocial mediaMobile applicationsAbout Canada.caTerms and conditionsPrivacyFrançais/Gouvernement du CanadaSearchMainThemes and topicsTesting devices for COVID-19: Serological testing devicesWe have archived this page and will not be updating it.We have archived this page and will not be updating it.Language selectionSearchMenuYou are here:On this pageSerological testsUnderstanding serological testing resultsVariantsSustainabilitySerological point-of-care testingHow to get an authorizationRelated linksPage detailsAbout this siteHealth CanadaGovernment of CanadaGovernment of Canada Corporateearly antibodies, called IgM antibodies, provide the first indication of the body's response to an infectionthese antibodies are not as specific and generally are not as long-lasting, so interpreting their significance requires clinical experienceIgG antibodies are specific to a virus, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virusearly research results suggest these antibodies can be reliably detected 14 days after a person is infected with COVID-19what has changed,  whether only the nucleic acids or also the antigens and antibodieswhether the test  detects nucleic acids, antigens or your antibodiesif the test detects  more than one part of the virussince variants are  expected, some tests are designed to detect more than one part of the virus“The performance of this device has not been  assessed in a population vaccinated against COVID-19.”“This  test identifies antibodies to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is  therefore unable to distinguish between previously infected individuals and  vaccinated individuals.”Manufacturers must assess  the impact of new variants of public health concern on their test, taking into account performance and  labelling, and include this assessment in their application.

Your report can help make these products safer for all Canadians.Report the issue as soon as possible after the reaction or problem occurred. You should do this even if you are not sure if a particular health or cannabis product was the cause.Drugs include pharmaceutical drugs, biologics and radiopharmaceutical drugs.Pharmaceutical drugs include prescription drugs (require a medical prescription to be dispensed) and non-prescription drugs (obtained without a prescription).Biologics (biotechnology products and blood products) are drugs that come from living organisms or from their cells. They are used to treat medical conditions such as diabetes and some forms of cancer.Radiopharmaceuticals are pharmaceutical drugs that have been made radioactive for the purpose of diagnosing illness.Medical devices range from adhesive bandages, toothbrushes and contact lenses to complex devices, such as x-ray units, insulin pumps and pacemakers. They also include in vitro diagnostic devices, such as cancer screening tests, blood glucose monitors and pregnancy test kits. They are used to treat, diagnose or prevent a disease or abnormal physical condition.Natural health products are naturally occurring substances. They are often made from plants, but can also be made from animals, micro-organisms and marine sources. They are used to prevent or treat an illness or condition, reduce a health risk or maintain good health. They come in a wide variety of forms like tablets, capsules, tinctures, solutions, creams, ointments and drops.Vaccines are products that produce immunity to a specific disease. Most vaccines are given by injection (needle) but some are given orally (by mouth) or nasally (sprayed into the nose). They protect people against serious and potentially deadly diseases, such as diphtheria, measles, polio and tetanus.Cannabis refers to the plant Cannabis sativa, which is used for its effects on the mind. It is also used for medical, social or religious purposes. Marijuana is a slang term for the dried flowers, leaves, stems and seeds of the cannabis plant.Veterinary drugs (prescription and non-prescription) are used to diagnose, treat or prevent diseases in pets and food-producing animals.Veterinary health products (such as vitamins and minerals) are low risk drugs used to maintain or promote the health and welfare of pets and food-producing animals. They are not used to diagnose, treat or prevent diseases.All marketed drugs and health products have benefits and risks. All health products are carefully evaluated before they are licensed in Canada. However, some adverse reactions or problems may become evident only after a product is in use by consumers.Your report helps to indicate if there is an issue with a health or cannabis product (a signal). Each single case has to be looked at and considered as unique. However, more than 1 report is usually needed to generate a signal.A signal is an initial indicator of an issue with the drug, health or cannabis product. However, it is not proof the drug, health, or cannabis product caused the adverse reaction or problem. We evaluate every signal to confirm or disprove a connection between the product and the reaction or problem.Controlled substances can also cause potential risks to your health.Reporting a suspected adverse reaction or medical device problem helps us:We monitor all reports and take the appropriate steps to protect Canadians.Skip to main contentSkip to "About government"Jobs and the workplaceImmigration and citizenshipTravel and tourismBusiness and industryBenefitsHealthTaxesEnvironment and natural resourcesNational security and defenceCulture, history and sportPolicing, justice and emergenciesTransport and infrastructureCanada and the worldMoney and financesScience and innovationCanada.caDepartments and agenciesHealth CanadaDrugs and health productsCOVID-19 health product industryDrugsMedical devicesVaccinesNatural health productsCannabisVeterinary drugsAdverse reactions, medical device incidents and health product recalls in Canada: 2019 summary reportMedEffect CanadaAdvisories, warnings and recallsAdverse Reaction DatabaseMedical device incidents databaseMedical devices establishment licence listingMedical Device Active Licence ListingMandatory reporting requirements for hospitalsSerious  adverse drug reactions and medical device incidents reported by Canadian  hospitalsContact usAll contactsDepartments and agenciesAbout governmentJobsImmigration and citizenshipTravel and tourismBusinessBenefitsHealthTaxesEnvironment and natural resourcesNational security and defenceCulture, history and sportPolicing, justice and emergenciesTransport and infrastructureCanada and the worldMoney and financeScience and innovationIndigenous peoplesVeterans and militaryYouthSocial mediaMobile applicationsAbout Canada.caTerms and conditionsPrivacyFrançais/Gouvernement du CanadaSearchMainMore InfoMore InfoMore InfoMore InfoMore InfoMore InfoThemes and topicsReport a side effectLanguage selectionSearchMenuYou are here:Choose a productDrugsMedical devicesNatural health productsVaccinesCannabisVeterinary drugsWhy you should reportRelated linksPage detailsAbout this siteHealth CanadaGovernment of CanadaGovernment of Canada Corporateidentify potential safety issuesimprove health product safety for all Canadiansidentify previously unrecognized, rare or serious adverse reactions or problemsadd to international data on the benefits, risks or effectiveness of drugs, health and cannabis productscommunicate changes in product safety information to industry, hospitals, health care providers and consumersundertake regulatory actions, such as changing the product label or removing a product from the Canadian marketEvery report counts.

Almost all positive results are true positives.False positive: You are not infected, but test positive (very rare).True negative: You are not currently infected. There is no risk of infecting others.False negative: You are infected, but test negative. Can happen when the test is done too early to detect the disease or when sample collection is poor.Positive test result: individual isolates.False negative test result: unaware of their infection and could infect others.Test accuracy based on a 5-day incubation period from exposure to symptoms.A blood test detects antibodies to the virus that usually start to appear when a person is recovering.This blood test is not used to diagnose active COVID-19.Research is underway to find out whether antibodies protect you from future infections.Based on preliminary data and expert opinion. Some do not develop symptoms. Test accuracy for asymptomatic cases is unclear as it is not known where they are in the disease timeline.Skip to main contentSkip to "About government"Jobs and the workplaceImmigration and citizenshipTravel and tourismBusiness and industryBenefitsHealthTaxesEnvironment and natural resourcesNational security and defenceCulture, history and sportPolicing, justice and emergenciesTransport and infrastructureCanada and the worldMoney and financesScience and innovationCanada.caDepartments and agenciesPublic Health Agency of CanadaDownload in PDF formatPublic Health Agency of Canada****Contact usAll contactsDepartments and agenciesAbout governmentJobsImmigration and citizenshipTravel and tourismBusinessBenefitsHealthTaxesEnvironment and natural resourcesNational security and defenceCulture, history and sportPolicing, justice and emergenciesTransport and infrastructureCanada and the worldMoney and financeScience and innovationIndigenous peoplesVeterans and militaryYouthSocial mediaMobile applicationsAbout Canada.caTerms and conditionsPrivacyFrançais/Gouvernement du CanadaSearchMainFootnoteFootnoteFootnoteReturn to footnotereferrerThemes and topicsUnderstanding COVID-19 testingLanguage selectionSearchMenuYou are here:Testing for the virusTesting accuracy depends on when you get testedTesting for antibodiesPage detailsAbout this sitePositive test resultNegative test resultInitial exposureIncubatingSymptomsRecoveringFootnotesPublic Health Agency of CanadaGovernment of CanadaGovernment of Canada CorporateDays 0-2: very low virusWorst days to testApproximately 98% not detectedThose tested too early will be unaware of infection and may infect othersDays 0 to 5: virus multiplyingApproximately 50% not detectedUp to half of those tested will get a false negative result and may infect othersDay 5 or more: virus plentifulApproximately 10% not detectedLow false negative rateDay 15 or more: virus decreasingMay take longer to recover from severe diseaseMay not be infectious to othersOrganization:Date published:Footnote 1Date modified:Given that virus variants  are common and expected, Health Canada continues to review available  information. We work with other regulators and manufacturers of COVID-19 test  devices to monitor any impact that variants may have on the ability of  diagnostic tests approved by Health Canada to detect COVID-19 variants. If an  issue is identified, we will work quickly with manufacturers and public health  laboratories to mitigate those risks.You can use it for research or reference.You can use it for research or reference.Find information on the requirements for getting medical devices authorized in Canada on thepage.Before submitting an application for authorization under Part 1.1 of the, please consult the.Antigen tests detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. They're often called rapid tests, as they typically provide results in less than an hour. These tests can be used by a health care professional or trained operator in a point-of-care setting, but lab-based antigen tests exist as well. Some antigen tests can also be used as a self-testing device outside of a professional setting. Some technologies require the use of a portable digital reader, while others use an optical readout and format similar to a disposable pregnancy test.We continue to  review antigen tests that meet an urgent public health need. Health Canada has authorized several antigen tests to date. See the.Always follow the instructions contained in your test kit or provided by your local health authority. The instructions are written specifically for that particular type of kit. If you take a sample in a different way, your test result may be invalid.Get more information on ourpage.There may be potential risks associated with the misuse, accidental ingestion or spillage on the skin of COVID-19 rapid test kit solution.Learn more about these.Variants of a virus are versions of the virus in which the nucleic acids  are different. Variants can affect the performance of a test. A false negative  result can occur with any test. However, the test is more likely to give a  false negative result if what it detects is changed as a result of the  differences in the variant.The impact of variants on each test will depend on:A negative test result should be considered along with a person’s  symptoms, history of exposure to the virus and the variant of virus that is  common in their area.Based on the evolving science, Health Canada has updated its policy position on serial testing with antigen tests in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations.For more information, please refer to our serial testing.Health Canada encourages  manufacturers to consider using recycled/recyclable, reusable, compostable and  sustainable materials when developing test devices. For instance,  manufacturers could consider using recycled/recyclable packaging materials and  inserts and/or reducing single-use components.Before submitting an application, manufacturers should consult  the(UPHN list).
