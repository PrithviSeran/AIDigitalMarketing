It includes various serogroups.Serogroups O1 and O139 usually produce the cholera toxin, which can cause severe diarrheal illness. These bacteria are the cause of cholera epidemics in other parts of the world. Occasionally, BC residents who travelled to affected countries may become sick with cholera.Other serogroups, known asnon-O1/non-O139, can be found in coastal waters worldwide, including in BC. A small number of BC residents have become ill withnon-O1/non-O139 after consuming contaminated BC seafood. These serogroups cause a milder diarrheal illness. Some can also cause skin or blood infections. In some cases,non-O1/non-O139 can produce the cholera toxin. This may result in more severe illness, but does not lead to cholera epidemics.Symptoms start between a few hours to 5 days after exposure. Infection with this bacterium can cause no symptoms at all, mild to moderate diarrhea or severe symptoms in about 10% of cases. Severe symptoms include:In severe untreated infections, up to 50% of people may die due to massive loss of fluid. Treatment and rehydration brings the death rate down to less than 1%.Symptoms start 12 to 96 hours after exposure and range from mild to moderate.In general, symptoms tend to be milder than in cholera and include:This bacterium can also cause wound infections with pain, redness and swelling at the site of infection.In people with weakened immune systems or with liver disease, the bacterium can infect the blood stream, causing fever, chills and a drop in blood pressure.grows naturally in brackish coastal waters and estuaries.O1/O139 is mainly found in Asian and African coastal environments. It can contaminate fresh water sources used as drinking water. It causes epidemics in parts of the world where there is inadequate sewage and drinking water treatment. Once it affects humans, it can be spread from person-to-person through ingestion of food and water contaminated with stool.non-O1/non-O139 is found in coastal environments worldwide. Infection can occur when people consume raw or undercooked seafood that has been contaminated withor when they accidentally swallow ocean water. The bacterium can also infect an open wound in contact with ocean water. This illness is not spread from person-to-person.If you have severe diarrhea, diarrhea lasting more than a few days or signs of dehydration, see a healthcare provider.In order to diagnose this infection, a healthcare provider will ask for a stool sample, which will be cultured forMostdiarrheal infections resolve on their own. They do not require any treatment other than oral rehydration. Some patients require IV fluids to rehydrate quickly. Some infections like severe diarrhea, skin or blood infections require antibiotics to get rid of the infection.‎Before travelling, visit a travel clinic and find out what diseases occur in the area you are travelling to. Most travellers are at low risk of cholera, unless they consume untreated drinking water and raw or undercooked seafood.There is a vaccine which can decrease the risk ofO1 infection. Discuss cholera vaccination with the travel clinic.Follow these precautions when travelling:People with cholera O1/O139 can infect others. Therefore, workers in high risk occupations, like cooks and caregivers must not work while infected. Children in daycare should not attend until they are free from infection.There is no vaccine fornon-O1/non-O139 infection. To reduce the risk of illness, follow these steps:Avoid water-based activities if you have open wounds.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

This public health initiative is supported by the BC Health Effects of Anomalous Temperatures (BC HEAT) committee and is being conducted by the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), a program of the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA).SITNet randomly selected potential participants from a sample of low-income residents without air conditioning who provided permission to be contacted for future projects when participating in the.Participants have been asked to install a cellular-connected sensor inside their homes to measure:The data collected by SITNet will help public health practitioners in the province to better prepare for and understand the health impacts of extreme heat events.SITNet randomly selected 30 participants from a sample of residents who provided permission to be contacted for future research when participating in the B.C. COVID-19 SPEAK Surveys. The sampling focused on low-income households without air conditioning.The launch of this project in 2024 represents the pilot phase. This project will continue until at least Fall 2024 when the BCCDC and BC HEAT will assess its value in the provincial extreme heat response. Based on these results, we may expand the network in future.Currently, SITNet is not recruiting more participants for the pilot phase. If you wish to participate in the future, keep watching this webpage for updates.SITNet uses cellular-connected indoor sensors that measure temperature, relative humidity, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) indoors from sources such as cooking or landscape fire smoke ().Enrolled participants have been mailed sensors to install inside their homes. Participants have been asked to mount the sensor to a wall and plug it in, so it can automatically connect to the cellular network. Data collected by the sensors are only available to the participants and the BC HEAT committee.is leading the SITNet project.For all questions, please contact us at:Sentinel Indoor Temperature Network TeamBC Centre for Disease Control and Prevention655 West 12th Ave, Vancouver, B.C. V5Z4R4Sentinel Indoor Temperature Network (SITNet)()Page printed:. Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Extreme heat events can be dangerous because many people in B.C. do not have air conditioning, and it can get very hot inside their homes. Research from the 2021 heat dome has shown that low-income individuals without air conditioning were at high risk of heat-related injury.The BCCDC and other agencies do not have reliable information about indoor temperatures. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to monitor indoor temperatures across B.C. to better understand the risk of indoor overheating during hot weather by establishing a reliable and distributed network of indoor temperature monitors.Data collected from the sensors are being collected into a databased stored at the BCCDC. The BC HEAT committee will use the database to access up-to-date information on indoor temperatures and air quality, to help manage extreme heat events when they occur. Data from sensors is anonymously displayed in the BC HEAT dashboard according to participants nearest city or town.Safeguards are in place to ensure participant privacy. Data collected for SITNet follows strict privacy practices under the B.C. Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The Act governs how information is collected, who sees it and how the information is used.We take the privacy and confidentiality of British Columbians seriously and have taken every precaution to ensure that SITNet data and information about participants is, safe and secure, the collection of any personal identifiers is entirely voluntary and is at the discretion of participants.See thefor more information about how to prepare for extreme heat and safe indoor temperatures.See the, including information on treating heat-related illnesses and heat strokeCopyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Research from the 2021 heat dome has shown that low-income individuals without air conditioning were at high risk of heat-related injury. The BCCDC and other agencies do not have reliable information about indoor temperatures. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to monitor indoor temperatures across B.C. to better understand the risk of indoor overheating during hot weather by establishing a reliable and distributed network of indoor temperature monitors.​Questions and inquiries:Indoor temperatureRelative indoor humidityIndoor fine particulate matter from sources such as landscape fire smokeIt looks like your browser does not have JavaScript enabled.

Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Best practices for a variety of fermented foods will assist food safety staff (health inspectors) with evaluating the safety of fermented foods and fermentation processes encountered during inspections.Owners and operators of food processing facilities may also find this guidance helpful as it reviews critical control points and measures recommended to produce safe fermented foods.The best available evidence guided this work at the time of publication.Each fermented food review includes:A national working group of health inspectors, food safety specialists, and industry fermentation experts worked together to create guidance on fermented foods. This guidance does not replace or supersede federal and provincial guidance or regulatory requirements for fermented foods. Health inspectors, food safety staff, owner and operators of food processing facilities should follow federal and provincial food safety requirements.(PDF) includes how fermented foods are described by substrate, fermenting agent or end-product. Includes an overview of the most common types of starter cultures, lactic acid bacteria, moulds, yeasts, alkaline, combined and SCOBY based fermentations.fermentation culture is described in depth highlighting spontaneous or wild ferments, commercial starters, back-slopping and evaluation of starter safety. Microbiological standards for fermented foods and safety and quality tests are outlined. This section also reviews chemical hazards of alcohol and biogenic amines in fermented foods.The PowerPoints provided here are intended as teaching aids.The content below links to other information useful for fermented foods safety.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

ferments of vegetables, e.g. cucumbers or pickles, are reviewed then contrasted with vinegar-based preservation(PDF)is a traditional European wild lactic acid fermentation of cabbage and salt(PDF) is a traditional Korean wild lactic acid fermentation of cabbage and salt, including red pepper powder, garlic, ginger, onion and other ingredientsare traditional South and West Indian dishes made of fermented cereals, rice and black gram that are ground, then fermented with salt, wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. The dough is fried (dosa) or steamed (idli)(PDF) is a traditional Egyptian fish dish that is dried before salting and wild lactic acid bacteria fermentation(PDF) is made of pasteurized milk that is cultured with commercial lactic acid bacteria and added flavour ingredients(PDF) is a fermentation of ground nuts (e.g. cashews) or nut liquids (e.g. coconut milk) made with commercial lactic acid bacteria and added flavour ingredients(PDF) is a traditional Japanese fermentation of boiled soybeans with commercial Bacillus subtilis culture that makes the soybeans sticky and savoury(PDF) include traditional Asian foods such as miso, soy sauce and a sweet beverage called amazake made with rice and cereals, such as wheat or barley. Koji foods are fermented with commercial Aspergillus oryzae moulds creating enzymes that break down carbohydrates into sweet (amazake) and savoury (miso, soy sauce) flavours(PDF) is a traditional Indonesian soybean cake fermented with commercial Rhizopus moulds(PDF) are fermented beverages of Asian and Russian origin made of black tea and sugar (kombucha) or green tea and honey (jun). Symbiotic cultures of bacteria and yeasts (i.e. SCOBYs) are re-used to create these carbonated, vinegar-based flavoured drinksare fermented beverages of Russian origin created with milk or water, sugar and tiny grains called kefir containing lactic acid bacteria, acetic-acid bacteria and yeasts, called a combined fermentation. The kefir grains are re-usedor charcuterie meats may be made from beef, pork or poultry and are fermented with commercial lactic acid bacteria, nitrites, salt and other ingredients. Molds often grow on the surface during ripening. These ready-to-eat sausages may be smoked hot (cooked), or cold (uncooked), and then dried. Examples include dry sausages such as pepperoni and semi-dry products such as summer sausage and cervelat salami(PDF) or 100 year old egg is made of duck, chicken or quail eggs and is an example of an alkaline processed food that is not actually fermented with a microbial culture.

Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.During wildfires, public health practitioners and emergency managers are faced with the daunting task of protecting the public from the threat of smoke- and fire-related illness.In order to assist public health decision makers in BC, BCCDC struck an international working group to develop consensus guidelines for use during wildfire smoke events.This guidance describes the wildfire smoke hazard, identifies the health effects that are associated with wildfire smoke exposure and the populations that are susceptible; provides BC-specific guidance about tools for situational awareness (smoke and health surveillance); summarizes the evidence for effectiveness of intervention measures to protect public health.This purpose of this Guideline is to describe how the Health Wildfire Smoke Response Coordination Group will support regional response to a wildfire smoke event that may impact the health of a population in BC.On June 1, 2021, Dr. Sarah Henderson presented on BCCDC Grand Rounds key information needed by individuals and public health practitioners to prepare for smoke before it arrives.  There have been catastrophic wildfires in western North America during the summer of 2016 through 2020, with no reason to expect any different in 2021.Theprovides information about (1) observed and predicted air quality, and (2) observed and predicted asthma-related health outcomes for BC Health Service Delivery Areas (HSDAs) and Local Health Areas (LHAs). The forecast predictions cover today and tomorrow. This information is intended to help BC public health professionals and the public anticipate and prepare for wildfire smoke events.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.While most incidences of shellfish poisoning occur from consuming raw oysters, exposures from recreational water contaminated with vibrio can also result in gastroenteritis and wound infections.Spikes in vibrio illness typically occur later in the summer months, in July, August and September. During the summer of 2015, 73 persons became ill with culture-confirmed vibrio after eating raw BC oysters. This is the largest outbreak of vibrio in Canadian history and was 2.5 times the number of cases expected. In response to this apparent outbreak of vibrio, Vancouver Coastal Health Authority banned the sale of raw oysters harvested on Vancouver Island for the first time since 1997. Among possible causes of the high number of 2015 cases was that seasonal sea temperatures during the spring and summer were, on average, 2 degrees Celsius above the norm..In response to this outbreak, the industry and their association, BC Shellfish Growers' Association, along with public health partners, regulators and others have engaged in many different activities in an effort to improve control, education, communication and surveillance of vibrio.A suite of tools to improve the control of vibrio have been developed over the past few years by industry experts.This calculator was developed by BCCDC as a research tool only, to estimate the potential growth of vibrio in shellfish. (Note that this tool is not a substitute for microbiological testing, which is the only accurate test for the actual growth of vibrio.)The calculator is in a spreadsheet format. Three examples of different storage conditions are included. Users input the initial Vp load, the oyster meat temperature the time in hours that the product is maintained at that temperature. (There will be a lag time before the temperature of storage and the meat temperature are the same.) The output provided by the calculator is the estimated concentration at the end of storage.This map shows charts of sea surface temperatures for the previous two weeks at 13 shellfish harvesting locations in BC.The map shows shows the status of shellfish harvesting sites in BC: whether the site is open or closed because of contamination or for sanitary reasons.Open the(page includes instructions for using the map). To view the map, wait for the map to load, then scroll to the end of the Terms of Use and click the I Accept button.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

In the display, sanitary closure information is always turned on and these areas will automatically display as red on the map underneath the green colour. This means shellfish species appearing green only occur in open areas and that these areas are not closed for biotoxins or under a sanitary closure.Water quality data is provided by the Environment Canada Climate Change (ECCC) program. Fecal coliform values are shown as counts per 100mL (derived from Most Probable Number or MPN tests). Data is described as:In addition to water quality data, the ECCC program conducts pollution source assessment including wastewater modelling and evaluation of marinas/anchorage areas to determine water quality in marine shellfish harvesting areas. The data shown on this map is sourced fromfromand may not include the most recent water quality survey.On the map users will see geometric means and the 90th percentiles calculated from the most recent water quality data posted.  Acceptable water quality are discussed in the, in section 4.1.3.1:Other standards for water quality data depend on the intended use of the growing waters, please consult the CSSP for criteria.Outfall is the generic term given to different types of effluent discharge, for example, discharges that come from community districts or businesses, and differences in the amount and frequency of the discharge at each site. There are two layers showing outfall locations on the map, both from publically available datasets within the Government of Canada and Government of BC.The Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations (WSER), developed under the Fisheries Act, came into force in 2012 to manage wastewater releases by systems that collect an average daily influent volume of 100 cubic metres or more. The outfalls displayed on the map are all operational wastewater systems located within 20km of BC coastal waters.Descriptions associated with each data point include:The AMS stores all documentation for waste discharge authorizations. The authorizations displayed on the map are all active effluent discharge authorizations located within 20km of BC coastal waters.Descriptions associated with each data point include:The SST product being used in these maps is the “SSTfnd” product”, which is the sea surface foundation temperature. This is the temperature at the first time of the day when the heat gain from the solar radiation absorption exceeds the heat loss at the sea surface, and it is free of diurnal temperature variability.  The sea surface foundation temperature usually occurs at a depth of about 10 metres below the surface. You can access sea surface temperatures in aon our site.To view the map, wait for the map to load, then scroll to the end of the Terms of Use and click the I Accept button.Shellfish Harvesting Status Map()Page printed:.

We acknowledge the inherent issues that come with a language guide sponsored by a government-funded organization. This guide is not meant to be prescriptive, and we recognize differences in language across communities, generations, and individuals based on history, context, and setting.To practice inclusive language, incorporate the following principles:“Treat others as they wish to be treated” rather than the golden rule of “Treat others as you wish to be treated.”Be flexible, revisit regularly, and adapt when needed.Focus on the person as an individual first. For example, “person/people with a disability” versus “physically disabled,” “crippled,” or “lame.” Note, if you are writing about a specific person use their preferred terms — these options are also included in this guide.Become aware of our own positions of power, privilege, values, and beliefs. This will help create understanding for the ways our positions impact people who access our resources. Aim to see beyond established ways of thinking. Work to understand the larger patterns, dynamics, and systems at play when reflecting on health disparities and inequities.Through self-reflexivity, we learn that it is impossible not to have assumptions and judgements. It is the awareness of our assumptions and judgements and knowing how they show up in our writing that will have the biggest impact on how relevant our work is to diverse lived experiences.The guide includes some examples of inclusive and equity-informed language for the following themes:Additional information:If you have comments, suggested edits, or to offer any observations and reflections, contactPublic Health Language Guide()Page printed:. Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Use inclusive and equitable terms that are relevant to your audience. Consider who may be missed when using certain terms to identify what inclusive and affirming words may be relevant to your unique setting and context.‎Reflect on who you are and your positionality or social location to understand personal and systemic biases and to develop and maintain respectful processes and relationships based on mutual trust. Cultural humility involves humbly acknowledging yourself as a learner when it comes to understanding another’s experience; this may be accomplished by the centring of the voices of the people with lived and living experiences when presenting information and key messages.Provide all options in a resource to respect people’s autonomy and agency in decision making.Use language that incorporates EQUIP Health Care’s Principles of TVIC to create safer environments through organizational strategies and personal practices. A progression of Trauma-Informed-Practice, TVIC “aims to minimize re-traumatization for people who have previously experienced violence, support people currently experiencing violence and draw attention to structural violence.”Use action- and-strengths-based language that will work to minimize harm and does not take a prohibitive approach. For example, instead of saying don’t drive a motorcycle, offer recommendations to make driving a motorcycle safer (e.g., wear a helmet, drive the speed limit, and don’t drive when using psychoactive substances). Harm reduction also includes challenging stigma and promoting social justice and human rights. Each person and every situation are unique so creativity and flexibility may be required for implementation in your unique setting and context.Everyone benefits from simple, concise writing that is easy to understand.Engage meaningfully with a diverse range of people who have lived experiences related to areas of work. Give them decision-making power in the design and delivery of resources; and pay them for their time and expertise.Aim to have language be relevant to as many people as possible. If your work is more specialized, aim to include language that is relevant to the diverse experiences people have. Explain new terms clearly and concisely. Avoid having people try and remember acronyms that are not common, this is especially challenging for people who are neurodiverse or have reading or cognitive issues/disabilities. Ensure materials meet accessibility standards for design and writing, including supporting screen readers, large font, plain design, and alt text.‎Use affirming language that clearly signals respect for diverse identities, bodies, and relationships. Once you know the words, terms, names, and pronouns people use when describing themselves and their bodies, use their words in a professional and respectful manner. Mirroring language can be a helpful tool in creating affirming environments for a diverse range of people.‎Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

They do not provide maximum daytime temperatures, temperatures that would be at the surface of the ocean or air temperatures, all of which would normally be higher than the values shown in the graphs. For more resources, see.For questions or comments, or for more information about accessing SST data from this application, please contactSource: JPL MUR MEaSUREs Project. 2015. GHRSST Level 4 MUR Global Foundation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (v4.1). Ver. 4.1. PO.DAAC, CA, USA. Dataset accessed daily at: Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology ().The SST product being used in these maps is the “SSTfnd” product”, which is the sea surface foundation temperature. This is the temperature at the first time of the day when the heat gain from the solar radiation absorption exceeds the heat loss at the sea surface, and it is free of diurnal temperature variability.  The sea surface foundation temperature usually occurs at a depth of about 10 metres below the surface.It looks like your browser does not have JavaScript enabled.

Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Provincially licensed meat plants are found throughout the province including in the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, the Kootenays and the Okanagan, as well as the North.Slaughterhouses that are federally registered are permitted to export their product to outside the province. Slaughterhouses which are provincially licensed are only permitted to sell their product within the province.An important aspect of ensuring meat is safe to consume is how meat is transported after the slaughterhouse. This applies to anyone who handles, transports, distributes and stores meat products and carcasses destined for public sale and human consumption. This includes owners and operators of food premises, such as licensed slaughter facilities, butcher shops, food retailers and those who transport meat products to any of these facilities.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

A working group has reported on causes, and provided examples of other risks to the safety of marine waters.ShortPageContentWorking group reportsTab Content 1Examples of hazardsTab Content 2Tab HeadingTab Content 3Tab HeadingTab Content 42Norovirus & Marine Water Contamination()Page printed:. Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Norovirus illness in raw oyster consumers was investigated by a working group chaired by BCCDC Environmental Health in 2017. Many agencies participated in this working group, including industry, academia and representatives from regional, provincial, federal and international regulatory and health agencies.The working group concluded there were several transmission routes of norovirus into the marine environment. All originated from human sewage sources. The working group also concluded that environmental conditions in 2016 and 2017 allowed norovirus in sewage sources to survive and reach shellfish farms.Posted with permission of Transport Canada. Locations of pump-out stations may be found on our.Marine waters can be negatively impacted by human activities. Marine water contamination risks include chemical hazards, radiation, and physical and microbiological hazards.Oil and fuel leaks from marine vessels contaminate the marine environment and are a concern when food sources and marine animals are affected.Swimmer pollution from sunscreen and suntan lotion is known to damage coral reefs. Chemicals such as zinc oxide, found in sunscreen, cause bleaching.A massive earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011 caused the nuclear power plant in Fukushima to fail. Several radioactive isotopes were released into the marine environment from nuclear fuel leaks.Marine mammals including southern resident killer whales are negatively impacted by the sounds of commercial and recreational vessels.A massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 washed out structures in Japan. Debris from the event was found on North American coastlines several years later.There are an estimated five trillion pieces of plastic floating in the sea, a major source of pollution. Plastics and microplastics are found in marine species and have been found in our foods.Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness in Canada. Over one million people (1 in 8) become ill with foodborne norovirus every year. When human sewage enters the marine environment it can contaminate our food supply. This has caused several outbreaks of norovirus in recent years.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

requested unless otherwise specified (e.g. serology tests).Label the sample container clearly with two identifiers (examples include patient name (surname and given name) and date of birth, PHN, accession number, unique random number. Ensure these two identifiers match the completed requisition.Ensure sample containers are tightly closed to prevent leakage during transport.Put the labelled samplethe sealable biohazard bag, and then seal the bag.  If the sample is liquid, place enough absorbent material in the bag to absorb the liquid should the container break or leak.  Put the completed requisition in thepocket of the biohazard bag.Refrigerate the prepared labelled sample where appropriate prior to and during transport.. Manipulation of samples prior to sending for PCR (molecular) testing may result in false negative or positive PCR (molecular) results.Unlabelled samplesLeaking samplesPatient name on the labelled sample does not match name on the completed requisitionSamples accompanied by undecipherable, blank or no requisitionsSample type collected in wrong sample containerUse the correct BCCDC Public Health Laboratory requisitions  or acceptable alternatives (e.g. interfaced orders)Provide mandatory informationUse the correct collection containerShip safelyUse the container (primary container) provided in the collection kit or as indicated in this guide.  See individual sections for specific collection and labelling instructions.  If capped, ensure it is fully closed to prevent leakage.Place the securely sealed primary container into plastic 'biohazard bag' (secondary container).

Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.: May 23, 2024Although B.C. is historically considered more temperate than the rest of Canada, the province has already experienced two deadly extreme heat events and more events are expected as the climate changes. In 2009 there were more than 100 excess deaths in one week due to heatwave that affected the greater Vancouver area. In 2021 there were more than 700 excess deaths in one week due to an unprecedented heat dome that affected the entire province.In response to the 2021 heat dome, multiple health sector partners and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) have developed a BC Heat Alert and Response System (BC HARS). This system lays out the criteria that ECCC will use to issue a Heat Warning or an Extreme Heat Emergency alert, the appropriate public health messaging for both types of alerts, and the recommended actions for health sector and other partners. The province will continue to refine and improve the BC HARS in the years ahead.In order to ensure that municipalities and health authorities are prepared for the public health risks posed by extreme heat, BCCDC assessed current perceptions and levels of preparedness of health authorities and municipalities regarding extreme heat.This review describes the interest in and approaches to addressing the risks associated with extreme heat by health authorities and municipalities in BC. From these findings, gaps in knowledge will be shown and recommendations made to advance heat response planning in BC.This guide can be used to help BC municipalities develop extreme heat plans, ideally in a way that these plans are integrated with existing emergency preparedness strategies.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Theis a collection of readymade and customizable resources that can be used to create a professional development or planning session for staff and management on health equity in environmental health. The toolkit includes:We recommend that first-time users of this toolkit start with the(PDF).This toolkit is based on(PDF), a collection of resources and tools created as part of the Through an Equity Lens project at BCCDC.Although originally developed for practitioners in BC, the toolkit is intended for use across Canada.The toolkit is designed primarily for EPHP team leaders and managers. All the materials are provided along with speaking notes and background information for facilitators. You don't need to be a health equity expert to use the toolkit, but some prior exposure health equity concepts and their application to EPH practice is helpful.If you are new to health equity, you may wish to consult with colleagues or a health equity specialist (such as a population health equity specialist, a medical health officer or a social health equity nurse with expertise in determinants of health).The toolkit includes three ready-made sessions as well as instructions and materials to create your own dedicated health equity session for EPHPs.You might use the toolkit to:You can also use any individual element (such as a PowerPoint slide, handout, video, group discussion question or interactive exercise) to facilitate discussion in an informal setting or meeting with staff and colleagues.The materials can be adapted for local use or supplemented with additional resources.This toolkit has been approved for professional development hours (PDHs) credit as part of the CIPHI Continuing Professional Competencies (CPC) Program. Log in to theto apply for PDH credit (1 hour for attending or 3 hours for planning and hosting a session).Each of the ready-made sessions includes an agenda, a PowerPoint presentation with speaking notes, optional interactive exercises and materials to host an internal session with staff or management on an equity-related topic.When you open the PowerPoint files there will be a security warning that "References to external media objects have been blocked." Click "Enable content" to be able to view the online videos embedded in some slides.This presentation introduces the concepts of health equity and the social determinants of health, illustrates ways that they can intersect with EPHPs’ practice, and briefly introduces a few ideas about how EPHPs might respond to health equity issues. It includes an optional group discussion exercise in which participants explore scenarios and discuss equity-related issues and how they could respond in practice.This workshop includes a brief introductory PowerPoint presentation and interactive small group sessions to introduce and learn how to use health equity tools for environmental public health practice. It builds on the material in the Introductory Session.This workshop includes a brief introductory PowerPoint presentation, optional discussion exercise, and a World Café module to explore how to increase capacity for health equity action in your department or organization.This part of the toolkit includes a master presentation that you can customize, a selection of exercises and a list of sample questions for group discussion.This(PPT) includes all slides for the toolkit and is organized by topic. For some topics, you will have a choice between a short presentation section (approx. 5-10 slides) or a summary slide (or slides) if you which to briefly review or highlight a health equity topic without going into detail. Speaking notes are included with all slides to provide additional background and ideas for how to present the material.We recommend including at least one brief interactive component for any session longer than 20-30 minutes. Sessions of two hours or more will benefit from one longer interactive component or several shorter ones. These components help keep the audience engaged and provide opportunities to practice using tools or connect new ideas to practice.Organize a world café to discuss ideas and values, or to generate ideas and new knowledge, about any health equity-related issue. It is particularly useful to get input about new concepts or to address complex problems or that do not have simple answers.This exercise illustrates how health equity issues might arise in environmental public health practice. It encourages self-reflection and can be used to guide discussion about how to consider the equity implications of common occurrences.This exercise uses a resource developed by BCCDC that use examples from real actions across Canada to illustrate key success factors and guide participants through a discussion to identify opportunities in their own work.This exercise uses a practical tool developed by BCCDC, NCCDH, and NCCEH to guide participants through a process that identifies actions individuals or organizations can take to support health equity.This exercise (from Winnipeg Regional Health Authority) can help identify actions individuals can take in their day to day work – or that organizations can implement to better support health equity. Use it as an individual reflective exercise or as a tool for small group discussion.Incorporate time for large or small group discussion into a session to gauge understanding and opinion, answer questions, or explore specific health equity topics in more depth.Feel free to use or adapt these forms to fit your needs.Please let BCCDC know how you use the toolkit.

Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Since 2008, Population and Public Health Surveillance has worked in partnership with the Health Officers Council of BC (HOCBC), the Ministry of Health, regional health authorities, and health organizations on health promotion and chronic disease prevention strategies aimed at reducing health inequities.In 2011, PHSA released a report,, that focused on actions the health system can take to reduce health inequities. The report recommended several actions that could promote the design and delivery of a health care system that would not exacerbate or increase health inequities. One of the report's recommendations was to set health equity targets and plans in consultation with communities and community members and actively monitor and measure their impact on health inequities.In support of developing health equity targets, we collaborated with health sector partners to develop a prioritized suite of health equity indicators for BC. This suite of 52 priority health equity indicators, released in 2014, could be used to provide evidence of health inequities in BC across various geographic, demographic and socio-economic dimensions, as a first step towards creating future action on equity. Since then, we have been reporting data related to these priority health equity indicators.This report provides data on health inequities in B.C. based on preventable and treatable premature mortality, covering the period from 2009 to 2013. Released: November 2019This report summarizes 16 of the 52 prioritized health equity indicators for BC. It provides current evidence for some health inequities in early life, adolescence, and adulthood among BC populations across geographic, demographic and socio-economic dimensions. Released: January 2016Describes the process used to develop a set of priority population-level health equity indicators that may be useful to monitor health equity across B.C. Released: October 2014Literature scan on appropriate indicators to measure health equity in B.C.'s health system. Released: March 2013This discussion paper outlines the actions the health system can take to promote health equity and ensure its policies, programs, and services are available, accessible, and acceptable to all. Released: 2010-2011In developing the discussion paper, working groups prepared additional resources related to reducing health inequities in three underserved populations of interest: individuals transitioning into and out of the corrections system, immigrants, and refugees.The BC Centre of Excellence for Women's Health developed two related papers. Taking a second look provides an epidemiological analysis of health inequities with a sex, gender, and diversity lens. Using the same lens, Worth a second look identifies considerations for policy action to reduce health inequities. Released: November 2009Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Through an Equity Lens includes a handbook, videos, workshop toolkit, and other resources to help the environmental public health system promote equity.Theis a collection of resources and tools created as part of the Through an Equity Lens project at BCCDC.We have produced a three-part Primer on Equity and Environmental Public Health (EPH) practice, written for practitioners, managers, and program directors.This(PDF) outlines five ways to begin integrating an equity lens into environmental health practice.This(PDF) highlights how two types of policy levers (governing instruments and policy drivers) affect the implementation of an equity lens, and highlights five key ways that policy can support leaders and decision makers to take further action.This(PDF) outlines case studies from environmental health practitioners across Canada who have applied an equity lens to their work. The case studies highlight some of the critical success factors, tools and strategies that are being used to integrate equity into environmental health practice.This(PDF) is an overview and checklist to guide thinking about how health equity and the social determinants of health relate to public health practice. The(PDF) puts the framework into context for three defined audiences: frontline public health inspectors and environmental health officers, managers and directors, and educational and professional development organizations.Theare five 5- to 7-minute videos that provide a simple and quick overview of health equity concepts and issues, targeted to environmental health officers (EHOs) and health protection leaders.Theis a collection of readymade and customizable resources that can be used to create a professional development or planning session for staff and management on health equity in environmental health.For more resources, please see, published in collaboration with the National Collaborating Centres for Environmental Health (NCCEH) and Determinants of Health (NCCDH).Email:Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.Sung Sik Jang, Lorraine McIntyre, Michael Chan, Paula N. Brown, Jamie Finley, Sally Xuanping Chen; Ethanol concentration of Kombucha teas in British Columbia, Canada. J Food Prot 2021Kombucha is a mildly sweet and acidic beverage considered to be a healthy alternative to sugary soda drinks. However, kombucha may contain residual alcohol from the multi-step fermentation process that converts sugar to alcohol. People at greatest risk from low levels of alcohol consumption include: young children, people who are pregnant and their developing babies, those with underlying medical conditions or those taking prescription medications that should not be mixed with alcohol, those who wish to avoid all alcohol for personal or religious beliefs, those with occupational concerns such as drivers, and those with alcohol use disorder.The purpose of this study was to determine if kombucha available for sale to the public in British Columbia contained levels of alcohol that could cause harm. This is a concern because kombucha that is manufactured and sold as a non-alcoholic beverage is not restricted for purchase as are alcoholic beverages which are only available in liquor stores and other licensed establishments. Kombucha is not labelled nor well known to consumers as potentially containing alcohol. In addition, when kombucha is sold as a raw, living, and unpasteurized beverage there is concern that alcohol may increase over its shelf-life or as a result of temperature abuse. There is currently no information about alcohol levels in kombucha products sold in BC. Other jurisdictions including the US, Australia, and New Zealand have found elevated alcohol in retail products exceeding regulatory values; peer-reviewed publications describe alcohol values in retail products typically ranging from 0.1 to 2% Alcohol By Volume (ABV) with some samples above 3% ABV.Kombucha alcohol (ethanol) levels were assessed for compliance with BC regulations that define a beverage as liquor (alcoholic) when it contains greater than 1% ABV. Alcohol (or ethanol) levels were detected by headspace gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (HS-GCMS) at the BCIT Natural Health Products Laboratory. This method is extremely sensitive in detecting low levels of alcohol with a detection limit of 0.0002%. In total, 684 samples representing 53 processors were collected during 142 separate visits to a variety of retail, restaurant, processor, farmers' markets, and other BC locations. A broad range of brands and varieties were selected as representative of kombucha products available to consumers at these purchase points, however this may not have included all brands produced or sold in BC. Temperatures of kombucha products at these locations were taken and products were examined for labelling information.Overall, 31.5% of kombucha samples exceeded BC regulations (i.e., contained levels of alcohol above the regulatory limit of 1% ABV). The highest level was found in BC restaurant kombucha (3.62% ABV). Over 70% of BC processors were identified as having a potential or definite problem with controlling alcohol in their products.[1] In comparison, 33% of kombucha imported into BC from other countries and provinces had potential or definite problems. Precautionary labels about alcohol were found for 54% of brands but often labels were in very small print; three brands displayed statements advising to avoid alcohol during pregnancy with only one including children in the warning. Illegible or unreadable best before dates were found in 5% of products sampled with place of business for the manufacturer poorly described. While 92% of products did advise to keep kombucha refrigerated no product labels explained that it was important to do this to avoid increases in alcohol content; one product advised that contents were under pressure and that the bottle may break if unrefrigerated.Consumers have a right to know which products have alcohol in them, how much alcohol is present, and what practices may later increase alcohol content. BCCDC recommends that kombucha processors label actual alcohol content and ensure that alcohol content does not increase during a product's shelf-life or during mishandling. Kombucha processors should monitor alcohol in their products and address this hazard as a health concern. BCCDC further recommends that federal authorities require precautionary labelling on products that can contain alcohol to allow consumers to make an informed choice.[1] A potential problem was defined as a processor who sometimes (in less than 20% of samples tested) had alcohol over 1% ABV in their kombucha and a definite problem was defined as a processor who often (greater than 20% of samples tested) had alcohol over 1% in their kombucha.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Dairy Plant and Dairy Worker licenses are valid until December 31 of the year issued.The Act and Regulations also specify standards for construction and equipment, dairy product quality (including strict microbiological and chemical controls), dairy plant worker education, pasteurization requirements and other operational standards. Dairy plants must be designed and operated in a hygienic and sanitary manner to reduce the likelihood of contamination of dairy products.Food service establishments can make dairy products for immediate consumption as per the(BC Reg. 224/2019). Please refer tofor more information as well as your local health authority or Environmental Health Officer for inspection and approvals related to your food service establishment.Once the plant is licensed, you must renew your licence each calendar year.Dairy plant licences are not transferable to a new owner (e.g. sale of dairy plant) or to a new operating location (e.g. new dairy plant). Please contact Food Protection Services and the dairy inspectors in advance so that an inspection can be completed and outstanding issues be corrected. When requirements have been met, the original license is cancelled and a new dairy plant licence is issued to the new licensee.If you are planning to make substantial changes to critical equipment (i.e. pasteurizers), renovations, construction, or add new products and production lines, you will need to contact the dairy inspector for their pre-approval. Please contact Food Protection Services with information about any planned significant changes to a licensed plant or new product lines so the dairy inspectors can advise on the next steps and what information must be submitted.In BC, under the Act, “dairy plant personnel” are persons engaged in specific duties in relation to dairy products for the performance of which licenses are required under the standards and qualifications established by regulation and must be licensed as dairy processing plant workers (dairy workers).Dairy plants apply for dairy worker licences on behalf of their dairy workers. A dairy worker may receive a licence with or without restrictions. Restrictions are noted by the licence being marked “Temporary” under the Restrictions section , if the applicant has not completed the minimum food safety training requirements at the time of application.In order to qualify for an unrestricted dairy worker licence, an individual must meet all of the following:There is no continuing education requirement for workers with an unrestricted licence.BCIT currently offers the only recognized dairy courses (Food 1151 and Food 2151) in BC.If you have received your dairy training elsewhere, please contact Food Protection Services with information about the course(s) to receive a determination of the equivalence of the content.To receive an unrestricted licence in BC, workers with experience and/or education from outside BC must:If you are applying for a licence for a worker new to a currently licensed plant during the calendar year, please useThis includes workers who were previously licensed in BC and workers seeking their first licence in BC. This application form is for a worker to receive a licence for the current calendar year. The process typically takes 1-2 months depending on the invoice payment method chosen by the plant.If you are applying for a licence for a new dairy plant with your initial workers, please use. This form will allow you to apply for your plant licence.Submit as many copies ofas needed for all dairy plant process workers with your new plant application. If you add additional workers later during the calendar year, please submit the New Worker at Currently Licensed Plant (Mid-Year Application).In mid-September, all currently licensed dairy plants will receive a custom application package via email for plant and worker licences for the next calendar year.was sent to all dairy plants on September 11, 2023 with information about the changes to the process and the application package.Plant and worker licences are not issued until after payment is received for worker licence fees. It is highly recommended that plants submit their licence applications for 2024 by midday (12:00 pm) of November 30, 2023 to ensure they can pay their invoice and receive their licences prior to January 1, 2024.Plants are strongly encouraged to submit their applications by email to fpinfo@bccdc.ca to reduce processing time and avoid the risk of applications being lost or delayed in the mail. Faxed submissions are no longer accepted. Submissions by mail are also accepted.There is no licence fee for a dairy plant.There is a $20 fee annually per dairy worker (worker licence fee). The worker licence fee is not pro-rated for licences issued during the year. Worker licences are not issued to dairy plants until invoices are paid in full.Renewal of plant and worker licences occurs each fall season so that plants have new valid plant and worker licences as of January 1st of the next calendar year and are compliant with the Act and Regulations. The process and general timelines are.A $250 administrative late fee is charged to plants, in addition to the worker licence fees, that do not submit their dairy plant applications prior to 12:00 PM of November 30, 2023 for worker licences for the next calendar year.If a plant has not paid its worker licence fees and the $250 late fee (if applicable) in full by end of day of January 11, 2024, a Prohibition Notice will be issued  on January 17, 2024 to cease operations until payment is made and licences are issued.Invoices for worker licence fees are issued by Provincial Health Services Authority to the billing contact information in the plant’s application. Do not send payments to Food Protection Services. Please seefor more information about payment methods.It is strongly recommended that payment to PHSA is made over the phone via credit card to prevent lost or delayed payments in the mail.InspectionTab Content 2Tab HeadingTab Content 3Tab HeadingTab Content 42Dairy Plant Licensing & Inspection()Page printed:. Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.If you are interested in constructing a provincially licensed dairy plant, please contact Food Protection Services to discuss the application steps with a dairy inspector. A detailed proposal including the building plans must be approved by a dairy inspector prior to the start of any construction. Please refer to theand documents needed for an application to inform your planning.Workers with a “Temporary” restriction on their licence must only work under the direct supervision of a dairy worker with no restrictions on their licence. Workers are encouraged to attain their educational requirements as soon as feasible to receive a licence with no restrictions.Plants are strongly encouraged to submit their applications by email to Food Protection Services to reduce processing time and avoid the risk of applications being lost or delayed in the mail. Faxed submissions are no longer accepted. Submissions by mail are also accepted.Authority to inspect dairy processing plants located in BC is granted under theand delegated by the Minister of Agriculture.For provincially licensed dairy processing plants, BCCDC Food Protection Services exercises delegated authority and operates an outcome- and risk-based inspection system.This system relies on the knowledge and expertise of Food Safety Specialists who conduct onsite visits at every provincially licensed dairy processing plant to identify potentially high risk processes and situations and to assess sanitary conditions. The inspection of federally licensed dairy plants has been primarily delegated to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.All provincially licensed dairy processing plants are required to submit monthly finished product samples to an independent laboratory for rigorous microbiological and chemical testing to ensure that relevant dairy product standards are met.If a finished product does not meet its relevant dairy product standard, follow-up action by the BCCDC is initiated and, depending on the case, can range from ordering a plant cleanup and follow-up inspection through to suspension of the dairy processing plant’s license to operate.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.BCCDC's STI Certified Practice Education Program is approved by theas a certifying education program for registered nurses practicing STI care.All applicants must meet the following prerequisites or they will not be considered.BCCDC's STI Certified Practice Education Program is approved by theas a certifying education program for registered nurses practicing STI care.BCCDC will provide BCCNM with the names and registration numbers of those nurses who have successfully completed the STI Certified Practice Education Program. To complete the certification process you must apply through BCCNM. Once BCCNM has received record of your successful completion from BCCDC you will receive communication from BCCNM that you have been entered into their Certified Practice registry.There is no charge for the STI Certified Practice Education Program. Participants are responsible for their own travel, accommodation and expenses for the clinical practice component.There are 22 seats available in each STI course, for a total of 110 seats per year. The breakdown of seat allocation per regional health authority (RHA) is based on population size, equity considerations, and historical seat use and course attrition.The majority of seats will require prearranged, health authority preceptorships. However, there will be 10 BCCDC STI clinic preceptorships available in each course session. Each health authority is guaranteed a minimum of 1 BCCDC practicum seat per course session. Three additional BCCDC practicum seats are available per course session to be allocated among RHAs based on need at the discretion of the STI/HIV education team.There will also be one seat in each course session for non-health authority applicants that will require a pre-arranged community preceptorship.The STI Certified Practice Education Program is divided into two components:The STI course content is divided into five modules including:Nurses complete a 3 day or 18 hour STI clinical practice experience after completion of the online theory course. The nurse will work with a BCCDC Provincial STI Clinic preceptor or a community BCCDC-approved preceptor to fulfil the 14 STI completion requirements.This practical experience is an essential component for the completion of the STI Certified Practice Education Program leading to BCCNM STI certification.This resource was developed to support STI Certified Practice RNs.  It is a space to share content and curriculum related to STI certified practice.  We will continue to add resources to this space.Go toand search for "".  Enter the passphrase "" to register.  You do need to have a PHSA LearningHub account to register.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

Integrating wildlife and environmental information with shellfish marine biotoxin data for public health purposes: a one-health workshopPage ContentThe following are the speaker presentations from the workshop, in order presented:Marine Biotoxin Workshop()Page printed:. Unofficial document if printed. Please refer to SOURCE for latest information.Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) improves the health of British Columbians by seeking province-wide solutions to specialized health care needs in collaboration with BC health authorities and other partners.The Marine Biotoxin Workshop took place on October 24-25, 2016 at the Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier in North Vancouver.Last summer (2015), high levels of domoic acid (DA), a neurologic toxin, were reported in BC shellfish. This led to the closure of commercial shellfish beds and the imposition of restrictions on self-harvesting by First Nations. Given the high reported levels of these biotoxins, there is a concern that populations in BC who engage in self-harvesting of wild shellfish and/or consume large quantities of shellfish may be at risk of toxic exposures. In the absence of regular and broad-based monitoring of shellfish along BC’s coasts, an alternative would be to utilize information about marine wildlife mortality or illness events that may have been caused by marine biotoxins; data would be gathered by agencies and institutions focusing on the marine environment and by coastal communities.To explore the potential sources of data on environmental factors, wildlife mortality events or unusual findings that may be associated with marine biotoxins or other hazards of public health relevance.To discuss potential avenues for collaboration between organizations or communities that collect such data, including data-sharing agreements, that would allow the subsequent development of suitable indicators for these hazards to be derived from the data.This workshop brought together environmental and wildlife marine scientists, researchers, representatives from First Nations, public health, industry, provincial, public and federal stakeholders.The workshop explored the available sources of non-traditional and augmented monitoring data that could be used to identify risks derived from marine biotoxins, which affect the marine ecosystem and potentially affect human seafood consumers.This workshop was made possible with support from:Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

What testing is carried out on wildlife mortalities?Are these events good predictors of the risk to shellfish harvesters?What are the long-term effects of fairly continuous low dose exposure to marine biotoxins? Is this adequately considered within the context of our current food guidance?Are the traditional/current diets of First Nations peoples adequately considered in risk assessment information? What do we know about current shellfish consumption by First Nations in coastal areas?How best to communicate risk regarding traditional diets? Do area closures really make a difference for self-harvesters?Do the sampling programs provide a robust enough sample to provide assurance that levels of biotoxins in food are below Canadian guidelines?What organizations would be interested in participating in a data-sharing network?Dr. Kathi Lefebvre - Health Effects of Domoic Acid in MammalssBC Centre for Disease ControlBCCDC Foundation for Public HealthFirst Nations Health AuthorityBC Government64(presentation unavailable as much of the work presented has not yet been published)It looks like your browser does not have JavaScript enabled.

The forum can be attended by public health professionals, immunization providers, nurses, physicians, midwives, pharmacists, naturopathic physicians, program managers and leaders.(PDF)(PDF) - Dr. Shannon MacDonald, Associate Professor on Nursing at the University of Alberta.Panel discussion: Impact of the pandemic on immunization across Western Canada:Practical ways to inoculate against misinformation for you and your patients – Ian Roe, Content Strategist, BCCDC & Renata Mares, Public Health ConsultantIn collaboration with First Nations Inuit Health and the government of Alberta, BCCDC hosted the Western Canadian Immunization Forum 2011 on December 7 and 8, 2011 at the Vancouver Convention Centre. The primary audience was staff at all levels involved with immunization program delivery in Western Canada.The proceedings of the morning plenary sessions from the “Forum on Immunizing in Schools” are archived below; permissions were obtained from the presenters for the posted presentations and accompanying audio.The goal of this two day forum was to share successes and lessons learned from school-based immunization programs in BC, with a focus on preadolescent/ adolescent age groups.Participants and presenters were mainly from the public health community, but also included those from education and clinical practice. The proceedings of the meeting, including afternoon breakout sessions, will inform the future work of the BC Immunization Subcommittee, which hosted this event, and implementation of the ImmunizeBC strategic framework on immunization.Copyright ©BC Centre for Disease Control.

There is currently no process in place for HCPs to have their Immunization Skills Checklist supervised and signed off independent of their employers; however, even in the absence of the ability to complete the Immunization Skills Checklist, HCPs are still encouraged to complete the BCCDC Immunization Competency Course for their own continued learning.Thisis a tool that can be used as a supplementary resource to the Immunization Skills Checklist.Immunization is a restricted activity under the Health Professions Act. Restricted activities are considered high risk activities that have been legally restricted through the Health Professions Act and assigned to specific health professions who have the education/competency to do them. Restricted activities are unique to each health professional designation, and listed in the health professional’s regulatory scope of practice which include limits and conditions on this practice.Health professional groups in BC which have autonomous immunization practice within their regulatory scope of practice are included here, along with the limits and conditions placed on their practice by their respective regulatory colleges.Select the appropriate health professional designation below for more information.Therequires Registered Nurses (RNs) who autonomously compound, dispense or administer vaccines to:The BCCNM requires that travel nurses and RNs working in vaccine research complete the BCCDC Immunization Competency Course, and travel nurses must follow the Canadian Immunization Guide in conjunction with the Canada Communicable Disease Reports. RNs working in other practice settings are strongly recommended to complete this course as part of their self-assessment and learning process. While the BCCNM does not explicitly require RNs to take the BCCDC Immunization Competency Course, it is required that RNs have the relevant competencies established by BCCDC.  Nurses largely acquire these competencies by taking this course. The provincial standard for health care professionals (e.g., pharmacists, naturopathic physicians) who autonomously immunize clients is to take the BCCDC Immunization Competency Course and as such many employers require RNs to complete this course as well. Many employers also require RNs working in Public Health and Community Health settings to complete theevery 3 years.Additionally, limits and conditions placed on RPN autonomous scope of practice for immunization include:RPNs are strongly recommended to complete the BCCDC Immunization Competency Course as part of their self-assessment and learning process.

Paramedics, including Community Paramedics (CPs), are not regulated under the HPA, but by the Emergency Medical Assistants Licensing Branch (EMALB). A memorandum of understanding between the EMALB and the BC Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) enables the BCEHS to create and operate a community paramedic program, select and train staff, identify the scope of services that the community paramedic can perform, ensure the CPs remain current and competent by establishing CPD requirements and monitoring compliance, and manage complaints relating to CPs.Therequires CPs who autonomously administer vaccines to:For more information go to the:In response to the SARS-CoV-2 Public Health Emergency, the Provincial Health Officer (PHO) has implemented several PHO Orders which permit Regulated and Unregulated Health Professionals to participate in the influenza and COVID-19 immunization programs.
