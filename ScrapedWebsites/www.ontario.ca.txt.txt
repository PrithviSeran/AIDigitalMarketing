Ontario generates 37% of the nationaland is home to almost 50% of all employees in high tech, financial services and other knowledge-intensive industries”.Ontario lies in the core of the North American Free Trade area, which includes more than 460 million people and generates a combined gross domestic product of more than $18 trillion (purchasing power parity, current international $). In 2011, more than C$ 1.4 billion crossed the Canada-U.S. border each day and Ontario-US trade accounted for approximately C$ 716 million of that amount.Ontario is part of the North American manufacturing heartland. Examples of Ontario's key manufacturing industries include autos, information and communications technologies, biotech, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.Here are some key facts about Ontario’s manufacturing sector:Ontario has more than half of the highest quality (“Class 1”) farm land in Canada. There are 51,950 farms in Ontario (Census of Agriculture, 2011) and they make up almost one-quarter of all farm revenue in Canada.Ontario’s agricultural production includes:Ontario’s forests play a major role in the province’s economy.

The mining industry in Ontario is a global leader in productivity and has world leading environmental standards. Ontario is among the top 10 producers in the world for nickel and platinum group metals. The province is also a significant producer of gold, copper, zinc, cobalt and silver. Southern Ontario produces non-metallic minerals including salt, gypsum, lime, nephelinesyenite and structural materials (sand, gravel, stone). The sedimentary rocks of the south are also the site of Ontario's oil and gas industry.Although Ontario is a manufacturing powerhouse, the services sector is the largest part of Ontario's economy.

Before the arrival of the European settlers, Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking Aboriginals had settled on the land.Experts aren’t sure about the exact translation of “Ontario”.  They know “Ontario” comes from an Iroquois word for beautiful water, beautiful lake or big body of water.Beginning in the 1600s, French and British settlers arrived in Canada and began to work the land. After the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), most of the land in Canada belonged to the British. The British called this area the province of Quebec, which included Quebec, Ontario and part of the United States.After the American Revolution (1775-1783), many American colonists who were loyal to Britain moved to Ontario. They were known as United Empire Loyalists. Many Iroquois also moved to Upper Canada from northern New York State.In 1791, the British enacted the, which split Quebec into two parts. Ontario was upstream of theLawrence River so it became Upper Canada and Quebec became Lower Canada.Upper Canada’s first capital was Newark, which is now Niagara-on-the-Lake. In 1793, the capital was moved to York (now Toronto) to protect it from American attacks. Upper Canada’s first Lieutenant Governor was General John Graves Simcoe.Throughout the nineteenth century, many immigrant groups moved to Upper Canada, including Germans, Scots and Mennonites. By 1830, the population of Canada was about 235,000.  Toronto became the first city in Ontario in 1834.In 1867, Ontario and Quebec became separate provinces.  They joined Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to form a federal union called the Dominion of Canada. This was declared in the. The new country’s capital was the small town of Ottawa and the first prime minister was Sir John A. Macdonald.Ontario is Canada's second largest province, covering more than 1 million square kilometres (415,000 square miles) - an area larger than France and Spain combined. Ontario is bounded by Quebec  to the east, Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and theLawrence River and the Great Lakes to the south.Here are some key facts about Ontario’s geography:Ontario’s varied landscape offers an abundance of natural resources. Learn more about these resources below:Ontario's many lakes, rivers and streams played a central role in the province's history and development. For Aboriginal peoples and the early European settlers, the lakes and rivers were a means of transportation and a source for food. Waterways determined the patterns of settlement as well as the patterns of industrialization.Here are some key facts about water in Ontario:70 million hectares – or 66% of Ontario’s land – is classified as forested land. By area, these forests represent about 18% of Canada's forests and 2% of the world's forests. Harvested wood is used to make building materials, pulp and paper and a wide range of other value-added products, such as furniture and flooring.But there is more than one kind of forest in Ontario. These include the deciduous forest of southern Ontario and the Great Lakes -Lawrence Forest of central Ontario. Northern Ontario is home to both the Boreal forest and the Hudson Bay Lowlands forest. A very small region of southern Ontario also includes Carolinian forest, which is home to the Kentucky coffee and sassafras trees – both species that can’t be found anywhere else in Canada!Ontario's varied climate and geography support habitat for more than 3,600 species of plants, 154 species of fish, 50 species of amphibians and reptiles, 483 species of birds, and more than 81 species of mammals. In Ontario's southernmost regions, you will find prickly pear cactus and sassafras trees, while polar bears roam our northern tundra.Common fish in Ontario include yellow perch, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. The mammals that call Ontario home include beavers, black bears, muskrats, gray wolves, white-tailed deer and walrus. Familiar birds include blue jays, northern cardinals, great blue herons, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls and pileated woodpeckers.

Since then, Ontario's provincial parks have stood for protection of the natural environment and enjoyment of the great outdoors. Today, Ontario's vast system of parks and protected areas totals over 9 million hectares, and includes areas of magnificent old-growth forest, woodland caribou ranges, wilderness rivers, wetlands and habitat for rare and endangered plants and animals.Our parks attract about 10 million visitors each year and provide places for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, swimming, canoeing, nature viewing and fishing. Parks are also important for scientific research, environmental monitoring and outdoor education. Most importantly, Ontario's provincial parks will protect and conserve our rich natural and cultural heritage for the benefit of future generations.Since Ontario’s first gold rush in 1866 near the town of Madoc, Ontario has been Canada’s leading metals producer. It produces more than 25 different metal and non-metal mineral products. In 2011, Ontario produced 43% of Canada’s nickel, 52% of its gold, 38% of the country’s copper and 84% of its platinum group metals.Ontario stone was used to build the Ontario legislature, the federal parliament buildings in Ottawa, and the Canadian Embassy Washington, DC.The ancient rocks of the Canadian Shield cover two-thirds of Ontario and host many mineral deposits. Younger sedimentary rocks also contain valuable minerals and unconsolidated glacial deposits are another important source of mineral riches.Amethyst, a variety of 6-sided purple quartz crystal, was adopted as Ontario's official gemstone in 1975. Amethyst, while occurring worldwide, is in rich supply along Lake Superior's north shore near Thunder Bay. It is also found in the Bancroft and North Bay areas.Ontario is an important Canadian petroleum refining region, ranking second behind Alberta in refinery production in 2011. Six facilities (4 fuel refineries, a petro-chemical facility, and a lubes plant) produced 26.7 billion litres (168 million barrels) of petroleum products in 2011. Last year, the province relied on imports to meet about 20% of petroleum product demand of 33.3 billion litres.With the exception of transportation, natural gas is the major fuel used by all sectors of the economy, including residential, commercial and industrial heating. In 2009, it provided almost 30% of Ontario's energy. Petroleum accounted for about 40%, and electricity for almost 20%.There are about 120 generating stations connected to Ontario’s power grid – nuclear, hydroelectric, gas, wind and bioenergy-fuelled. Together, these stations are capable of generating approximately 35,000 megawatts of electricity.Ontario’s 5 nuclear plants have a capacity of about 11,000 megawatts. Ontario’s 70 hydroelectric generating stations have a capacity of over 7,900 megawatts.Ontario now has more than 1,000 wind turbines with a capacity of more than 2,000 megawatts, making Ontario the Canadian leader in wind power.With a population of more than 13.5 million, Ontario is home to about 2 in 5 Canadians.
